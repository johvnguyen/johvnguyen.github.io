        <p>
            I am a software developer at <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/">John Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHUAPL)</a> 
            working on deploying machine learning (ML) models and modelling/simulation efforts to validate ML systems.
            My foremost interests are in differential privacy and machine learning. In particular, I enjoy studying how we can use privacy attacks against ML models.
            In the summer of 2021, I began working at JHUAPL in the Air and Missile Defense Sector. During the spring of 2020, I graduated from the
            University of Minnesota with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics and a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
